### The Client

Mindy Mackenzie, the prior Chief Performance Officer of Beam, Inc., is known as the &ldquo;Velvet Hammer&rdquo; for her tough-yet-caring style of leadership. She is a _Wall Street Journal_ best-selling author of the book _The Courage Solution: The Power of Truth-Telling with Your Boss, Peers, and Team_, and the creator and host of the annual _You First Integrative Leadership Summit_, equipping women of influence to reach even greater heights.

### The Problem

Mindy was dissatisfied with the value she was receiving with her current web designer and host; in advance of her book launch, she needed a more responsive site that could easily be updated.

### The Solution

We took over hosting her site, updating it regularly for the book launch, and highlighting her media appearances in conjunction with that launch. We also created and continue to maintain the pages for her _You First Integrative Leadership Summit_, including online registration.

### The Business Impact
  
> <p class="quote">Daniel is the best partner you could hope for in a web designer and for handling web maintenance! He is smart, creative, resourceful and fast. Daniel is able to produce high quality work on short time frames and with minimal creative direction and hit the mark over and over. The best part, is Daniel is a joy to work with. He is smart, customer-centric and trustworthy. If he says he will get it done, he does. After having a poor experience with another firm, I can highly recommend Daniel for all your website design and support needs â€“ he&rsquo;s terrific!</p>

<hidden-section heading="The Process">

  In late 2015, We assumed maintenance of her site several months in advance of the book launch. We created a custom WordPress type to highlight her Media Appearances, automatically ordered from most recent to older. She had a lot of short video content, and we implemented code that displays a different video each week on the front page.

  In early 2018, we developed the pages for her _You First Integrative Leadership Summit_, with speaker bios, conference schedule, and an application form. We have continued to maintain these pages across the 2019 and 2020 summits.
  
  We continue to provide backups, WordPress support, and content updates for Mindy&rsquo;s site.
