### The Client

_The Shark Tank_ is a news and opinion site centered on south Florida politics (and the state at large). They provided extensive coverage of Rep. Allen West&rsquo;s winning campaign in 2010, and continue their focused news and opinion on current political races.

### The Problem

They were displeased with their current theme; it was struggling with the amount of content they were producing.

### The Solution

They had identified a theme that would better suit their needs. We set it up, ensuring that their content would fit in the new theme&rsquo;s requirements, and helped them turn off parts that they didn&rsquo;t need. We also converted the social media connections from their old site to a style that would work nicely in the new theme.

### The Epilogue

This was all they needed; they returned their focus to their writing.
