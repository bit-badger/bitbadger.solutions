## Legacy Data Sharing

Do you have data that's old &mdash; and by &ldquo;old,&rdquo; we aren&rsquo;t talking &ldquo;iPhone 6&rdquo; old, we&rsquo;re talking &ldquo;this data [could run for President][old]&rdquo; old? Just because the information is in an older &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; system doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to stay there. [Learn how our solutions can help get this data where you and your customers can access it more easily][legacy].

## Why Web-Based?

Web-based solutions have many advantages:

- They can be used just on a local, private network (an intranet) or on the public Internet.
- They are available to any device connected to the network.
- They require no special software; every device has a browser - which you're using to read this!)
- They can get your most critical needs met first, then evolved and improved over time.
