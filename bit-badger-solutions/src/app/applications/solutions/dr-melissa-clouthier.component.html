      Dr. Melissa Clouthier saw our work with <a routerLink="/solutions/cassy-fiano"
      title="Cassy Fiano | Bit Badger Solutions">Cassy</a>&rsquo;s site, and asked us to help her move off Blogger as
      well. Melissa blogs from the political right, but also covers health issues and social media. She had been
      blogging for a several years, and wanted to bring her old content with her to her new site.

      <h3>What We Did (2009)</h3>
      <p>
        We created a custom theme based on another site, and developed graphics to complement that theme. We also
        imported the content from her Blogger site into the WordPress site, and created a featured content template for
        the front page.

      <h3>What We Did (2018)</h3>
      <p>
        Melissa decommissioned her site; we took final snapshots of the information there, then assisted with shutting
        it down.
