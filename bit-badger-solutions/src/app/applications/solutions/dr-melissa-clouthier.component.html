    <h3>The Client</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Melissa Clouthier (now Mackenzie) blogged from the political right; she also covered health issues and social
      media techniques and utilization.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      She had seen our work with <a routerLink="/solutions/cassy-fiano"
      title="Cassy Fiano | Bit Badger Solutions">Cassy</a>&rsquo;s site, also wanted to move off Blogger; however, she
      did not want to lose her years of posts up to that point.
    </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      We created a custom theme for her site, imported the content into a WordPress site, and created a specialized
      front-page template. She obtained hosting elsewhere; Bit Badger Solutions maintained it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small><em>(NOTE: The thumbnail of the site represents a new skin on the original theme; while the theme is the
      same, Bit Badger Solutions did not create the graphics.)</em></small>
    </p>
    <h3>The Epilogue</h3>
    <p>Melissa decommissioned this site in 2018; we took final snapshots of the data before shutting it down.</p>
    <app-hide-section heading="The Process">
      <p>
        Initially, we created the theme based off another well-known blogger's site, which had been developed by one of
        WordPress's core contributors. We also advised on the type of hosting she would need for her site, and moved
        seveal domains there. We also took care of regular backups of her data.
