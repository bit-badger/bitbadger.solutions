    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Daniel needed a place to journal his learning journey with the Linux operating system, and thought that allowing
      others read this journal would help them learn as well.
    </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Bit Badger Blog</em> contains that journal, plus tech tips and information for many different aspects of
      technology. It is written, maintained, and hosted by Bit Badger Solutions.
    </p>

      <p>
        The initial posts were titled &ldquo;My Linux Adventure,&rdquo; and existed as static files that were edited to
        add each post. Daniel then wrote a rudimentary system that stored the posts in a database, which meant that the
        entire site did not need manual changes &ndash; what a breakthrough! :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the <em>Bit Badger Blog</em> (and the <em>DJS Consulting Tech Blog</em> before it) has served as a
        place to support <em>(now inactive)</em> WordPress plug-ins, and go in depth on servers, databases, programming
        languages, and open-source software. It has also served as a useful live website for learning and
        experimentation with different content management systems and blogging tools. It has existed in at least 8
        different tools, with links preserved as systems change.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is currently a statically-generated site, utilizing <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>, and its code is
        <a href="https://github.com/bit-badger/blog.bitbadger.solutions">open source</a>. New posts are infrequent,
        but the information it has is good. It may have more behind-the-scenes posts about future open-source efforts.
        Stay tuned!
