      The Bit Badger Blog grew from Daniel&rsquo;s personal experience with learning and using the Linux operating
      system. His first experience with blogging consisted of pages that had to be edited every time a new post was
      made. The initial posts were titled &ldquo;My Linux Adventure,&rdquo; and existed as a copy of this home-grown
      blog. The Bit Badger Blog has that, plus tech tips regarding many different computer products. It covers web
      servers, databases, programming languages, and open-source software. Bit Badger Solutions also hosts 64-bit RPM
      builds of xine, a Linux multimedia player; the blog, via the RSS feed for that category, can deliver notices of
      updated versions directly to subscribed users. Finally, it also contains notices of new versions of Bit Badger
      Solutions-developed WordPress plug-ins (&ldquo;Daniel&rsquo;s Dropdowns&rdquo; <em>(inactive, as its
      functionality is now part of the WordPress core)</em> and &ldquo;HCSB Verse of the Day (Plus)&rdquo;).
