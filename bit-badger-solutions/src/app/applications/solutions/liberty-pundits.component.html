      At its founding, Liberty Pundits was a joint venture by 3 established bloggers (Melissa Clouthier, Bill Dupray,
      and Clyde Middleton) that, in their words, was aimed at becoming the new home for conservatives on the Internet.
      With the three of them all being prolific bloggers in their own right, and the help of many contributors, Liberty
      Pundits was a bustling hub of information.

      <h3>What We Did</h3>
      <p>
        Bill and Clyde had been part of Patriot Room, an already-recognized powerhouse, and their desire was for
        Liberty Pundits to contain the content that they had contributed to Patriot Room. The technical lead on that
        blog had moved on, so we did some divining of what was there. Once we deduced the current setup, we obtained
        the data from that site, determined how it would need to be manipulated to become part of a WordPress blog,
        then accomplished the data migration. Initially, this was deployed on the same shared hosting account where
        LibertyPundits.com, their podcast distribution site, already resided. The site&rsquo;s traffic quickly
        overwhelmed that solution. They then were moved by their host to a
        <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr>, which performed moderately better, but still had quite a few
        issues, mostly related to the site&rsquo;s traffic volume. We recommended a new server configuration, including
        migrating from a fully-featured web server to a more lightweight web server, along with caching, and configured
        that server. This configuration eliminated the bottlenecks, and enabled them to have several 100,000+ hit days
        with no appreciable slowdowns.

      <h3>What We Still Do</h3>
      <p>
        Bit Badger Solutions maintained the server, keeping it current with performance and security upgrades. We also
        provided support to the primary 3 bloggers, when they had questions about WordPress or how the site was
        performing. The site closed in August of 2011, as the primary authors moved on to other endeavors.
