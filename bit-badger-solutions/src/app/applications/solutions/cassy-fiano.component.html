    <h3>The Client</h3>
    <p>
      Cassy Fiano (now Cassy Chesser) began blogging back in 2007 on Blogger. She worked hard to network with other
      bloggers, wrote prolifically, and gained a large audience with her coverage of life issues and of Sarah Palin as
      the first female Republican vice-presidential nominee.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      With her success, Cassy was quickly outgrowing Blogger. She was interested in moving to a different platform;
      specifically, Movable Type, as she had some authoring experience with that platform.
    </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      We migrated her content to a WordPress site, and customized a theme to look very similar to her Blogger theme
      (which she liked). We maintained the site, and began hosting it a few years later.
    </p>
    <h3>The Epilogue</h3>
    <p>Cassy formally decommissioned this site in early 2014.</p>

      <p>
        Initially, we assisted her with finding a theme, and customized it. We also modified her old Blogger template
        to send redirect users to her new blog after displaying a note that the blog had moved. A few years later, we
        developed an advertising banner to generate income from her writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In July 2012, we began hosting the site, as we were already hosting her military wife blog
        <a routerLink="/solutions/hard-corps-wife" title="Hard Corps Wife | Bit Badger Solutions">Hard Corps Wife</a>.
        When the time came to decommission the site, we backed up the data and ensured she had it.
