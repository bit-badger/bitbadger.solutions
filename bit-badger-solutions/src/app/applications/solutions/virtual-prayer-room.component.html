    <h3>The Client</h3>
    <p>
      Our existing client <a href="http://hoffmantown.org" title="Hoffmantown Church">Hoffmantown Church</a> in
      Albuquerque, New Mexico, with whom we had worked on the <a routerLink="/solutions/nsx/"
      title="Not So Extreme Makeover: Community Edition | Bit Badger Solutions">Not So Extreme Makeover: Community
      Edition</a>
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Hoffmantown had seen the use of this physical prayer room dwindling over the years. People had become less
      willing to drive to the church, especially at night, and security became an issue as well; either prayer warriors
      had to know how to disable the security system, or the church would have to remain unlocked.
    </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      The development of Virtual Prayer Room extended the prayer room to anywhere a prayer warrior can get an Internet
      connection! Prayer warriors could enlist right from the site, and had to be approved. Requests and updates were
      tracked by date/time, and warriors could record when they&rsquo;ve prayed for a request from the site, or from
      clicking a link in the daily e-mail they received with requests from their interest areas. As many prayer needs
      are confidential, security and confidentiality were very important. Virtual Prayer Room ensured these by
      providing varying security levels for prayer warriors and the ability to mark each request as confidential.
    </p>
    <h3>The Epilogue</h3>
    <p>
      In 2016, Hoffmantown Church elected to begin using another package for their prayer requests. While a few other
      churches had expressed interest in it, none ultimately decided to use it; so, in 2017, Virtual Prayer Room was
      officially decommissioned.
