    <h3>The Client</h3>
    <p>
      Dan Riehl began blogging as <em>The Carnivorous Conservative</em> back in 2004, specializing in the areas of
      crime and politics. He changed to <em>Riehl World View</em> a short time later, and writes both news and opinion
      pieces. He was a prolific blogger, publishing over 15 posts a day on most days.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      He wanted to take his blog in a different direction, and was having trouble getting his Movable Type blog do move
      with him.
    </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      We stood up a WordPress site on a server he procured. We then assisted him in selecting a theme and customized it
      to his liking. Finally, we wrote custom migration code to get his past body of work into the new site. In 2018,
      we generated static files for most of his prior posts, to give him a clean slate for a new direction. We continue
      to maintain and support <em>Riehl World News</em>.
