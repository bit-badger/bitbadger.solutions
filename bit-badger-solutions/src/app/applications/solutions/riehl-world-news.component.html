      Dan Riehl began blogging as &ldquo;The Carnivorous Conservative&rdquo; back in 2004, specializing in the areas of
      crime and politics. He changed to &ldquo;Riehl World View&rdquo; a short time later, and writes both news and
      opinion pieces. He was a prolific blogger, publishing over 15 posts a day on most days. He wanted to take his
      blog in a different direction, and was having trouble getting his Movable Type blog do move with him.

      <h3>What We Did (2012)</h3>
      <p>
        We spoke with him regarding his ideal direction and assisted through the selection and customization of his
        eventual chosen theme. We also did some work on the customization of that theme. Additionally, we imported the
        large volume of posts from the Movable Type blog into his new WordPress blog.

      <h3>What We Did (2018)</h3>
      <p>
        Dan wanted a fresh start for Riehl World View, so we generated flat files to preserve his prior archive. The
        post volume meant that none of the existing WordPress plugins that do that would work, so we built a custom
        converter to preserve that content.
