  <h1>Web Services and APIs</h1>
  <p>
    A web service is a way of using the Internet to provide or accept information that makes sense to computers; this
    allows other sites or applications to consume information from, or provide information to, your service. This
    enables communication between applications, without having to establish any communication channels other than the
    ones that web browsers already use. It isn't the best fit for every application, but when it is useful, it is
    <em>very</em> useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> can be a synonym for a web service, but it can also
    be a generally accessible way of providing data. For example, Twitter has a public API, which other applications
    can use to display tweets on their site.

        from the computer where the images resided.

        time you go there, then utilizes a stateless API to access data from the browser.
