    <h2>Legacy Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Do you have data that's old &mdash; and by &ldquo;old,&rdquo; we aren&rsquo;t talking &ldquo;iPhone 6&rdquo; old,
      we&rsquo;re talking &ldquo;this data
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_candidacy#United_States" title="Age of Candidacy (United States) | Wikipedia">could
      run for President</a>&rdquo; old? Just because the information is in an older &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; system
      doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to stay there.

      this data where you and your customers can access it more easily</a>.

    <h2>Why Web-Based?</h2>
    <p>Web-based solutions have many advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>They can be used just on a local, private network (an intranet) or on the public Internet.</p></li>
      <li><p>They are available to any device connected to the network.</p></li>
      <li><p>They require no special software; every device has a browser - which you're using to read this!)</p></li>
      <li><p>They can get your most critical needs met first, then evolved and improved over time.</p></li>
    </ul>
