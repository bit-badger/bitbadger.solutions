  h1 Legacy Data Sharing
  p.
    Our background in mainframe applications gives us a knowledgeable perspective on retrieving information from
    older, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; systems. This data can be migrated to a more modern relational or document database,
    where a web application can retrieve the information; in some cases, the data can even be exposed as a web service
    in place. These types of systems are often a great way for companies to expose their data to their customers,
    without having to move their day-to-day system from its current environment. While we currently have no active
    projects along these lines, our developers have done them in the past for other organizations; sadly, none can be
    linked publicly.
